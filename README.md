This JavaScript code aims to remove a specific number (numToRemove) from an array (numbers) by shifting the subsequent elements to fill the gap. The process involves iterating through the array, identifying the target number, and then rearranging the elements to exclude it.

Identifying the Index:

A for loop is used to iterate through the array until the target number (numToRemove) is found.
The loop breaks when the target number is located, and the index (i) is captured.

Shifting Elements:

Another for loop is initiated, starting from the identified index (i), to shift elements one position to the left.
This effectively removes the target number from the array.

Adjusting Array Length:

The array's length is decremented to eliminate the last element, which is now a duplicate of the preceding one.
Displaying Result:

A final loop is employed to iterate through the modified array and log each element to the console.
In summary, this code snippet provides a manual method for removing a specific number from an array by rearranging the elements and adjusting the array's length accordingly.
